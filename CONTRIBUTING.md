## Development Workflow

### Adding or modifying a component

All components live in `packages/web-components/src/`. Each component is a Lit web component organized by tier:

- `content/` — Static display components (Badge, Card, Text, etc.)
- `reactive/` — Interactive components (Button, Input, Modal, etc.)
- `application/` — Layout and shell components (AppShell, Sidebar, TopBar, etc.)

After modifying a web component, run Prism to regenerate framework bindings:

```bash
cd packages/prism-generator
node src/cli.js
```

### Conventions

- **Web components**: `arc-component-name` (kebab-case tag), `ArcComponentName` (PascalCase class)
- **React wrappers**: `ComponentName` (no Arc prefix)
- **Events**: `arc-event-name` with `bubbles: true, composed: true`
- **Styles**: All components import `tokenStyles` from `../shared-styles.js`
- **Tokens**: Use design tokens from `shared/tokens.css` — never hardcode colors, spacing, or fonts

### Pull Requests

- Create a feature branch from `main`
- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Include a clear description of what changed and why
- If adding a new component, include a docs page in `demo/src/data/components/`

## AI / LLM Policy

ARC UI welcomes contributions that use AI and LLM tools as part of the development workflow. We recognize these tools can accelerate development and help contributors be more productive.

**Requirements:**

- **All AI-generated code must be reviewed and verified by a human before submitting a pull request.** The submitter is responsible for understanding every line of code in their PR, regardless of how it was produced.
- **PRs must pass all existing checks** — AI tools do not exempt contributions from quality standards.
- **Disclose significant AI usage** in your PR description if the majority of the code was AI-generated. A simple note like "Authored with AI assistance" is sufficient.

**Automated / agentic PRs:**

Pull requests opened by fully autonomous agents, bots, or agentic solutions (e.g., OpenClaw, Sweep, or similar services) without meaningful human review **will be automatically closed**. We value human judgment in the review process. If you use an agentic tool, you must review its output yourself and submit the PR from your own account with your own sign-off.
